- Integrate multi-payment tracking and digital invoicing
Scope
- Mobile App (React Native + Expo)
- Web App (React + Zustand)
- Supabase Backend (PostgreSQL + Storage + Auth + RLS)
- Vercel Edge Functions
- Offline storage (SQLite / IndexedDB)
- Notifications, Reporting Dashboard, and external integrations
System Architecture
React Native mobile, React web, Vercel Edge API, Supabase backend, and external services for
